## Requirements
Requires some form of C++ compliation; preferably g++.

## Usage
+ Invoke the make command to create an executable called floydWarshall.exe
+ Run the executable with..
  + ./floydWarshall [inputSize] [true/false]
  + Where inputSize is the size of the weighted graph
  + True for more dense graphs and false for more sparse graphs
+ Runs 2 implementations (one optimized) of the Floyd Warshall Algorithm with random weights and outputs the average run times of both 
## Concepts and Languages Used
+ How Floyd Washshall is performed and where optimizations could be made.
+ C++ was used because it is a high level language I felt comfortable using.
+ Timing the performance of algorithms in C++ using high-resolution clock.
